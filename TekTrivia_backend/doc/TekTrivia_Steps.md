# TekTrivia Implementation Guide

## Introduction

TekTrivia is a quiz platform designed to promote learning and knowledge sharing among Epitech students. The platform transforms learning into a gamified experience where users can create quizzes, test their knowledge, and compete with others. This document outlines the implementation steps required to complete the backend development of the TekTrivia project.

## Current State Analysis

The project currently has a basic structure with several Django apps:

- **Users**: Implements user models (Player, Admin) and authentication
- **Achievements**: Defines ranks and titles for the gamification system
- **Quizzes**: Defines quiz structure, questions, and resources
- **Notifications**: Implements a notification system
- **Blog**: Placeholder for blog functionality (not implemented)
- **Leaderboards**: Placeholder for leaderboard functionality (not implemented)

The authentication system uses custom token-based authentication with separate models for Player and Admin tokens.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Complete User Management System

- Add level-up notifications

**Importance**: This provides a sense of progression and unlocks new features.

**Good Practices**:
- Balance XP rewards to ensure steady progression
- Use database transactions for XP updates
- Cache level requirements to reduce database queries

### 4. Implement Leaderboards

**Why**: Competition drives engagement and provides social recognition.

**Tasks**:
- Create Leaderboard models for different ranking types (global, promo, university)
- Implement API endpoints for viewing leaderboards
- Add scheduled tasks for leaderboard updates
- Implement pagination for leaderboard results

**Importance**: This adds a competitive element and showcases top performers.

**Good Practices**:
- Use caching for leaderboard data to improve performance
- Update leaderboards asynchronously to avoid impacting user experience

## Conclusion

This implementation guide outlines the key tasks required to complete the TekTrivia backend. By following these steps and adhering to the good practices outlined, the development team can create a robust, scalable, and maintainable application that meets the requirements specified in the project documentation.

The tasks are organized in a logical order, with foundational components like authentication and user management coming first, followed by core features like the quiz system, and then additional features like leaderboards and tournaments. However, the team may choose to prioritize differently based on specific project needs or resource availability.

Regular communication between team members is essential to ensure consistent implementation and to address any issues that arise during development. Code reviews should be conducted for all significant changes to maintain code quality and knowledge sharing.
